# Bellabeat-casestudy-SQL-Power-Bi-
Bellabeat's casestudy (SQL(Bigquery) + PowerBi).

Since the project is based on the free version of Google Cloud BigQuery the datasets have a life expctancy of only 2 months and as such, the PowerBi files may be damaged.
If the the following occurs, there is also a .pdf file containing a copy of the dashboard altough it is not interactive.

Summary:

the goal of the project is to analyze the datasets provided by the company Bellabeat, choosing one or more of the products of the company and to define an effective
marketing strategy in order to improve said product and Bellabeat position in the fitness accessories market.

This project which was given by the Google analytics course (project nÂ°2) was made with the use of Python, this project was mostly done for fun and practice in the data analytics
field, hence why the overlook on a lot of the problems in the datasets provided.

This analysis can also be seen on my <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mkance5/code">Kaggle account<a> in a jupyter notebook format,
where I explain in more detail the analysis process.

Thank you for reading.
